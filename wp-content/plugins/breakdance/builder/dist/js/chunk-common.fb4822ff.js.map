THE DOCUMENT OR GLOBAL STORE\n *\n * Most likely, whatever property you wish to add belongs\n * in the configStore.\n *\n * The document and global stores are only for storing things\n * that are manipulated by the user AND that will be saved to\n * the backend when the user clicks the Save button\n *\n * If it will be associated with the document the user is editing,\n * (i.e. saved in the post meta), it belongs in the document store.\n *\n * If it will be associated with the the whole website, (i.e. saved in\n * the sitewide options table), it belongs in the global store.\n *\n * If clicking save shouldn’t send the data back to the WP database,\n * it does not belong in the document or global store.\n *\n * UNDO / REDO:\n *\n * All mutations to the properties of the document and global\n * stores can be undone/redone.\n *\n * It is important to understand how Undo works (this explanation\n * is slightly oversimplified):\n *\n * When opening the builder or switching documents, the initial\n * states of the global store and document store are saved.\n *\n * All mutations made to the document store and global store are\n * logged.\n *\n * To undo the last mutation, the document and global store are\n * reset to their initial states. Then, all the mutations except\n * the last mutation are re-run.\n *\n * This method only works if the mutations are deterministic / pure -\n * i.e. given a particular initial state, running the same set of\n * mutations in the same order will always produce the same new state.\n *\n * THEREFORE, mutations must be deterministic.\n *\n * THEREFORE, IF YOU ADD A PROPERTY TO THE DOCUMENT OR GLOBAL STORE,\n * YOU MUST MODIFY THE UNDO FUNCTIONALITY (hint: probably in the BreakdanceUndo class) TO:\n *  - 1. Ignore the mutation that initially sets the property (hint: probably BreakdanceUndo.mutationsToIgnore)\n *  - 2. Store the initial value of the property (hint: probably BreakdanceUndo.initialize())\n *  - 3. Reset the value of the property (hint: probably BreakdanceUndo.resetToInitialState())\n *\n * UNSAVED CHANGES PRESENT WARNING:\n *\n * This warning takes the same approach as Undo - watch the\n * document/ global store for mutations, set a flag if a mutation\n * occurs (but ignore the mutations that initially set the values),\n * and unset the flag when the page is saved.\n *\n * If you add a property, you'll have to ensure setting it initially\n * is ignored - probably in Save.vue.\n */\n\nconfig.rawError = true;\n@Module({ name: \"document\", namespaced: true })\nexport default class DocumentModule extends VuexModule {\n  document: BreakdanceDocument = defensiveCopy(NO_DOCUMENT);\n\n  @Action\n  duplicateElementAndActivateIt(elementId: number) {\n    const elementSlug = findNode(this.document.tree, elementId)?.data.type;\n    const transactionKey = `DocumentDuplicateElement:Slug:${elementSlug}`;\n\n    breakdanceUndo.transaction(\n      () => {\n        const pointerForCreatedNodeId: { nodeId?: number } = {\n          nodeId: undefined\n        };\n\n        this.duplicateElement({\n          elementId,\n          pointer: pointerForCreatedNodeId\n        });\n\n        if (pointerForCreatedNodeId.nodeId !== undefined) {\n          uiStore.activateElement(pointerForCreatedNodeId.nodeId);\n\n          breakdanceStoreActions.run.onCreatedElement({\n            elementId: pointerForCreatedNodeId.nodeId,\n            transactionKey\n          });\n        }\n      },\n      `Duplicate ${getBuilderElementNameBySlug(elementSlug)}`,\n      transactionKey\n    );\n  }\n\n  @Action\n  deleteElement({ nodeId }: { nodeId: number }) {\n    const parentNode = getNodeParent(this.document.tree, nodeId);\n    // eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-unused-vars\n    const maybeNode = findNode(this.document.tree, nodeId);\n\n    if (!maybeNode) return;\n\n    const allIdsOfElementsToBeDeleted = getIdsFromNodeAndDescendants(maybeNode);\n\n    allIdsOfElementsToBeDeleted.forEach(id =>\n      breakdanceStoreActions.run.onBeforeDeletingElement({ elementId: id })\n    );\n\n    // Wait for \"onBeforeDeletingElement\" actions as they may need to access the DOM before we delete the element(s)\n    forceNextTick(() => {\n      if (parentNode !== false) {\n        uiStore.activateElement(parentNode.id);\n      }\n\n      const transactionKey = `DocumentDeleteElement:ID:${nodeId}`;\n\n      breakdanceUndo.transaction(\n        () => {\n          this.deleteElementMutation(nodeId);\n        },\n        `Delete ${getBuilderElementNameBySlug(maybeNode?.data.type)}`,\n        transactionKey\n      );\n    });\n  }\n\n  @Action\n  addElement({\n    elementSlug,\n    addToNodeId,\n    placeToAdd\n  }: {\n    elementSlug: string;\n    addToNodeId?: number;\n    placeToAdd?: PlaceToAddElementInTree;\n  }) {\n    const transactionKey = `DocumentAddElement:Slug:${elementSlug}`;\n\n    breakdanceUndo.transaction(\n      () => {\n        const pointerForCreatedNodeId: { nodeId?: number } = {\n          nodeId: undefined\n        };\n\n        const placeToAddElement =\n          placeToAdd ||\n          findPlaceToAddNodes(\n            this.document.tree,\n            addToNodeId === undefined ?
